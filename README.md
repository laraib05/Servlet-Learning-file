# Servlet and JSP Learning Journey
Overview
This repository documents my progress and understanding of Servlets and JavaServer Pages (JSP), which are essential components of Java's web development ecosystem. This journey has deepened my knowledge of how to build dynamic web applications using Java.

Topics Covered
Servlets
Introduction to Servlets

Learned about the role of Servlets in Java web development.
Explored how Servlets handle HTTP requests and responses.
Lifecycle of a Servlet

Initialization: init() method.
Request Handling: service() method.
Termination: destroy() method.
Deployment Descriptor (web.xml)

Configured Servlets and mapped URLs using web.xml.
Understood the role of annotations like @WebServlet for simpler configurations.
Session Management

Explored techniques like cookies, HttpSession, and URL rewriting to maintain state in web applications.
Request and Response Handling

Learned how to read data from HTTP requests (GET and POST) and generate dynamic responses.
Worked with request attributes and parameters.
Filters and Listeners

Studied how to use Filters for preprocessing and postprocessing requests.
Understood the role of Listeners in application lifecycle events.
JSP (JavaServer Pages)
Introduction to JSP

Discovered how JSP simplifies HTML generation by embedding Java code directly into web pages.
Understood the importance of separating presentation and logic.
Lifecycle of JSP

Translation Phase: JSP is translated into a Servlet.
Compilation: Translated Servlet is compiled.
Request Processing: Compiled Servlet processes requests.
JSP Tags and Directives

Explored various tags:
Scripting Tags (<% %>, <%= %>, <%! %>)
Directives (<%@ page %>, <%@ include %>, <%@ taglib %>)
Used Expression Language (EL) for accessing data in a simpler way.
JSP Implicit Objects

Worked with implicit objects like request, response, session, application, out, etc.
Custom Tags and JSTL

Created reusable custom tags for dynamic content generation.
Leveraged JSP Standard Tag Library (JSTL) for common tasks like iteration, conditionals, and formatting.
Error Handling in JSP

Configured error pages to gracefully handle exceptions and display user-friendly messages.
Highlights of My Learning
Deployed my first project on a server and successfully tested the end-to-end flow.
Gained hands-on experience with:
MVC Architecture: Used Servlets as controllers and JSPs as the view.
Data Persistence: Integrated with databases using JDBC.
Session and State Management: Ensured seamless user experiences.
Future Goals
Dive deeper into Spring Framework to enhance my understanding of modern Java web development.
Integrate JSP and Servlets with RESTful APIs and microservices for scalable applications.
Explore advanced concepts like JSP tag libraries and third-party integrations.
Technologies Used
Languages: Java
Tools: Apache Tomcat, IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse
Database: MySQL
Other Libraries: JSTL, JDBC
Conclusion
My journey through Servlets and JSP has been incredibly rewarding. These technologies have laid a strong foundation for building robust and dynamic web applications. I'm excited to continue expanding my skills and applying this knowledge to real-world projects.
